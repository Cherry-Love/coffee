          Rumor has it that the first cup of coffee may have been drunk in
          Ukraine, when in the 17th century our lands were attacked by the
          Turks. Whether this is true or not, we will probably never know. But
          there is no need to prove that Ukrainians have fallen in love with
          this drink - the average city dweller drinks about 600 cups of an
          invigorating potion a year.

          This manufacturer of coffee products is not a newcomer to the
          Ukrainian market either - the unique assortment of the company has
          been available to us since 1992. More than 60 types of Arabica and
          Robusta, unique blends of Italian roasts for coffee machines and an
          exotic line of 100% Arabica gourmets: Kopi Luwak, Blue Mountain,
          Hawaii Kona, Ecuador Galapagos. A new recipe is being developed,
          roasted, ground, processed and packed by Ukrainian specialists at
          factories in Lviv.

              Delving into the history of the unique fragrant drink, we are
              returning to the streets of Lviv again. It was here, back in 1829,
              that the first coffee house was opened. Its founder is considered
              to be Yuri Kulchitsky, a native of a Western Ukrainian village,
              who helped liberate Vienna from the Turks and received 300 bags of
              coffee as a gift. Kulchitsky taught Europeans to drink an
              invigorating drink, and now, according to his unique old recipes,
              “Kava z Lvova” is made at the Lviv plant.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main suppliers of raw materials for the plant were coffee
              plantations from India, Brazil, Ethiopia and Colombia.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to the latest technologies and qualified specialists
              brought from Germany, Spain, India and Brazil, this plant, the
              first in Ukraine, has the ability to produce 2,000 tons of coffee
              per year.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Ukrainian coffee is not prepared at a large factory - it is
              roasted by a married couple from Kamyanets-Podilskyi using secret
              technologies. The recipe and the bean supplier are kept in strict
              confidence, however, Alexey and Natalia convince that it is 100%
              Arabica.

              The whole charm of a small enterprise is that the manufacturer
              does not roast the beans for the future - coffee is prepared
              individually for each customer. Products can be ordered through
              the website.

                <span>aesthetics</span> (delicate chocolate aftertaste,
